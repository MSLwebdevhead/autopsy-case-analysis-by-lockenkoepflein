## Introduction

Digital forensics is a critical field that helps uncover the truth behind cyber incidents. This repository provides a hands-on approach to understanding how to analyze USB stick images and recover important data. We use Autopsy to explore deleted files, examine metadata, and produce forensic reports.

## Project Overview

In this project, we create a USB stick image and perform a detailed analysis. The main objectives include:

- Recovering deleted files.
- Analyzing manipulated data.
- Understanding file structures and metadata.
- Generating a comprehensive forensic report.

The project emphasizes practical skills in digital forensics and incident response.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install Autopsy. Follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Autopsy from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MSLwebdevhead/autopsy-case-analysis-by-lockenkoepflein/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided in the installer.

### Prerequisites

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher.

## Usage

Once you have installed Autopsy, you can start analyzing the USB stick image. Follow these steps:

1. Open Autopsy.
2. Create a new case.
3. Add the USB stick image to the case.
4. Use the tools provided by Autopsy to explore the image.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [official Autopsy documentation](https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/latest/).

## File Analysis

Autopsy allows you to recover and analyze various file types. Here are some key features:

- **Deleted File Recovery**: Autopsy can find and recover files that have been deleted from the USB stick.
- **File Type Analysis**: You can examine different file types, including images, documents, and executables.
- **Metadata Examination**: Autopsy provides insights into file metadata, such as creation dates and modification history.

## Forensic Report

After completing the analysis, you can generate a forensic report. This report includes:

- A summary of the case.
- Details of recovered files.
- Metadata analysis.
- Timeline of file activities.

To create the report, navigate to the "Reports" section in Autopsy and follow the prompts.

## Timeline Analysis

The MACB timeline is a crucial aspect of digital forensics. It helps visualize the timeline of file events:

- **M**: Metadata changes.
- **A**: Access events.
- **C**: Creation events.
- **B**: Deletion events.

Autopsy can generate a MACB timeline for the analyzed USB stick image, providing valuable insights into user activities.

## Topics Covered

This project touches on various important topics in digital forensics:

- **Autopsy**: A digital forensics platform for analyzing hard drives and smartphones.
- **Cybersecurity**: Understanding threats and vulnerabilities in digital environments.
- **Digital Forensics**: The process of recovering and investigating data from digital devices.
- **Forensic Report**: Documentation of findings from forensic analysis.
- **Incident Response**: Steps taken to address and manage cybersecurity incidents.
- **USB Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing data from USB storage devices.
